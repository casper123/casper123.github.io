We are passionate about making a real and lasting contribution to our neighborhood and enabling safe and convenient trading between local people.\n \nWHY SHOULD I USE RAPID CITY EXCHANGE?\n- Nothing in life is free....But Rapid City Exchange is! 100% Free to use.\n- Rapid City Exchange is run by a local Rapid City family, not a national Brand that doesn't care!\n- We monitor Spam and scams! You report it and we take care of it..Period.\n \nHow did Rapid City Exchange begin?\nChris and his family of six moved to Rapid City and set about looking for some used items. After a thorough search of the internet and the local small ads, Chris and his family were no closer to finding what they needed. Every other city they have moved to in the military had its own city classified website!\nIt was obvious that Rapid City desperately needed a quality online marketplace that the community can back, that wasn't diluted with spam and scams. Instead of unmonitored content and shady sellers, people needed great security, a family-friendly policy and great technology to ensure the safety of its members.\n \nRapid City Exchange was born.\nThe mission is simple: to provide a cost-effective, safe and friendly one stop shop for our community: one that also provides a vital resource for our neighbors and friends.",
